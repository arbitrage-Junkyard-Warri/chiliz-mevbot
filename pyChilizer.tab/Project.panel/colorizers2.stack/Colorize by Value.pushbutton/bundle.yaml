title: "Colorize by Value"
tooltip: |
  Colour-code elements in current view by the chosen parameter.
  This tool uses the 'Override by Element' method and does not create filters. 
  Note: The appearance of elements will not change if the parameter changes! Use 'Reset Overrides' and re-run the tool again for updated results. 
  Or use the Filters by Value to see results that change in real time.
